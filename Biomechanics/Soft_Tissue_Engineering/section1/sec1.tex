\subsection{Estimating tissue strenght based on a uniaxial tensile test}

The tissue strenght is here defined as the ultimate stress value obtained in a uniaxial tensile test, before damage occurs. Since uniaxial 
tensile tests were performed on circumferentially ($P^{ult}_{\theta\theta}$) as well as axially ($P^{ult}_{zz}$) oriented samples, we can define the strength 
in the circumferential as well as in the axial direction.
